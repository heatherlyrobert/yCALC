.SH NAME
yCALC \- fast, powerful, flexible, shared calculation engine

.SH PATRON
.B kottus-hecatoncheires

ancient greek world-shattering giant

.SH IMAGERY
ugly, impossibly powerful, one-hundred handed, fifty-headed giant

.SH SUMMARY
yCALC is a clean, reliable, debuggable, and shared library for creating
and executing fast, flexible byte-code calculations that can be used in any
programming context (spreadsheet to system utility).

.SH SERIOUS FOREWARNING
i am a crazy, selfish, dog-fooding c-programmer.  i set unrealistic and
audacious goals, and therefore my software tends to be experimental, very
personalized, and constantly evolving.

my user-base is exactly one.  i never planned to share software with end-users,
my intention is to expose my code to other programmers so we may learn from
(and laugh at) each other.

the point is not to be the best.  its to challenge myself and learn how to
build fullsome, reliable, transparent, custom, and very maintainable software.
it may not be universally liked, but i hand-coded very byte ;)

a) overview        quick summary

.SH A) OVERVIEW
at present, yCALC is focused mainly on supporting gyges (my spreadsheet),
but will ultimately be used in a simulation package as well.  these man pages
supplement the gyges pages by describing the operators and functions available
in gyges formulas.

since there are too many functions in yCALC to describe comfortably in a
single man page, this man file is simply the launching point for the more
detailed category 6 man pages listed above in DOCUMENTATION FILES.

additionally, there are a series of demonstration videos on operators and
functions on my website.
